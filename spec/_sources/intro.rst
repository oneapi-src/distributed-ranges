 Introduction
==============

Distributed Ranges is a productivity library for distributed and partitioned memory based on C++ ranges.
It offers a collection of data structures, views, and algorithms for building generic abstractions
and provides interoperability with MPI, SHMEM, SYCL and OpenMP and portability on CPUs and GPUs.
NUMA-aware allocators and distributed data structures facilitate development of C++ applications
on heterogeneous nodes with multiple devices and achieve excellent performance and parallel scalability
by exploiting local compute and data access.
