Productivity library for distributed and partitioned memory based on
C++ Ranges.

About
-----

Distributed Ranges is a productivity library for distributed and partitioned memory based on C++ ranges.
It offers a collection of data structures, views, and algorithms for building generic abstractions
and provides interoperability with MPI, SHMEM, SYCL and OpenMP and portability on CPUs and GPUs.
NUMA-aware allocators and distributed data structures facilitate development of C++ applications
on heterogeneous nodes with multiple devices and achieve excellent performance and parallel scalability
by exploiting local compute and data access.

Contact us
----------

We seek collaboration opportunities and welcome feedback on ways to extend the library,
according to developer needs. Contact us by writing a `new issue`_.


Examples
--------

See `Sample repository showing Distributed Ranges usage`_ for a few well explained examples.
Additionally you may build all tests of this repository to see and run much more examples.

Build and test with gcc for CPU::

  CXX=g++-12 cmake -B build
  make -C build -j all test

Build and test with ipcx for SYCL && CPU/GPU::

  CXX=icpx cmake -B build -DENABLE_SYCL=ON

See how example is run and the output::

  cd build
  ctest -VV

Adding Distributed Ranges to your project
-----------------------------------------

See `Sample repository showing Distributed Ranges usage`_
for a live example how to write CMakeLists.txt. Alternatively you may read details below.

If your project uses CMAKE, add the following to your
``CMakeLists.txt`` to download the library::

  find_package(MPI REQUIRED)
  include(FetchContent)
  FetchContent_Declare(
    dr
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/oneapi-src/distributed-ranges.git
    GIT_TAG main
    )
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(dr)

The above will define targets that can be included in your project::

  target_link_libraries(<application> MPI::MPI_CXX DR::mpi)

If your project does not use CMAKE, then you need to download the
library, and install it into a prefix::

  git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/distributed-ranges.git dr
  cd dr
  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
  make -C build install
  cmake -B build-fmt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> build/_deps/cpp-format-src
  make -C build-fmt install

Use ``-I`` and ``-L`` to find headers and libs during compilation::

  g++ -std=c=++20 -I <prefix>/include -L <prefix>/lib -L /opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib/release -lfmt -lmpicxx -lmpi

Logging
-------

Add this to your main to enable logging::

  std::ofstream logfile(fmt::format("dr.{}.log", comm_rank));
  dr::drlog.set_file(logfile);
